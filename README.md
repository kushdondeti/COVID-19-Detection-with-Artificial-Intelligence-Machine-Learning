# COVID-19-Detection-with-Artificial-Intelligence-Machine-Learning
Training an Artificial Intelligence algorithm with chest x-ray images to be able to detect whether a person has COVID-19, another respiratory illness(MERS, pneumonia), or is healthy. 

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major outbreak all over the world and made a
severe impact on the health and life of many people. A critical step in the fight against the
COVID-19 pandemic is effective screening of infected patients. This will help to detect
the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this
disease from radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the
patients. In this research work, we study the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to
detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. Firstly, to build an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) model, we collected some data of chest X-ray images of healthy people
and patients with COVID-19. We used a subset of a publicly available data set. Then, we
used a technique called deep learning to build a classifier to distinguish between healthy
and patient people from chest X-ray images. This technique focuses on deep artificial
neural networks which are inspired by the human brain and can learn from data to perform
tasks. Nowadays, these models can perform so efficiently in solving real-world problems.
Since medical data sets have limited numbers of samples and training deep learning
models with millions of parameters is so computationally expensive, training a deep
neural network classifier from scratch is cumbersome. So, we chose a pre-trained deep
neural network and optimized it for our task with a few steps of training on chest X-ray
images. In our results, we showed that the model can perfectly detect COVID-19 patients
from chest X-ray images with about 97% accuracy.
